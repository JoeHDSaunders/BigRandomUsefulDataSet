# BigRandomUsefulDataSet

The scripts use to create the repositary are at https://github.com/JoeHDSaunders/BigRandomUsefulDataSetScripts/
All scrips where wrote in python 3.4.1 if you wanted to know.

The data may conatain data that may cause erros in code such as " and "" and False True which may need to be corrected.

XML AND JSON are the only two formats at the moment. It follows a standard file format all the way through just select the XML or JSON folder at the start
then all data is the same just in diffrent formats.

Enjoy
